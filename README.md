## Description

This app receives a number from the user between 0 and 400000000000, and returns a list of the range of numbers. However, every number containing a 1 is replaced with 'Beep!', then every number containing a 2 is replaced with 'Boop!', and then every number containing a 3 is replaced with 'Won't you be my neightbor?' This list is displayed after pressing submit or pressing enter on the input field.
